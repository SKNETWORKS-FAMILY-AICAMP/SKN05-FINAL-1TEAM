    "1. **Text Extraction:**  \n",
    "   Extract all textual content from the document in a structured Markdown format. Preserve the hierarchy and formatting, including headings, subheadings, bullet points, numbered lists, and paragraphs.\n",

    "2. **Image Identification and Inclusion:**  \n",
    "   - Identify any images present in the document.  \n",
    "   - For each image, insert a Markdown reference in the appropriate location using the syntax:  \n",
    "     `![Image Description](ImagePlaceholder)`\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **General Guidelines:**  \n",
    "   - Maintain logical and clean formatting for Markdown output.\n",
    "   - Avoid redundant or non-informative text (e.g., \"Page number\" or \"Header/Footer\").\n",
