Incorrect use can shorten battery life or\ncause leakage, overheating, fire, or explosion.\n\nLi-ion Batteries\n\nThe battery is not charged at shipment. Charge the battery\nbefore use. Keep the battery in its case when not in use.\n\nRead this section if your camera uses a rechargeable Li-ion\nbattery.\n\nNotes on the Battery\n\nThe battery gradually loses its charge when not in use.\nCharge the battery one or two days before use.\n\nBattery life can be extended by turning the camera off when\nnot in use.\n\nBattery capacity decreases at low temperatures; a depleted\nbattery may not function when cold. Keep a fully charged\nspare battery in a warm place and exchange as necessary,\nor keep the battery in your pocket or other warm place and\ninsert it in the camera only when shooting. Do not place the\nbattery in direct contact with hand warmers or other heating\ndevices.\n\nCharging the Battery\n\nThe battery can be charged using a BC-W126S battery charger\n(available separately). Charging times will increase at ambient\ntemperatures below +10 °C (+50 °F) or above +35 °C (+95 °F).\nDo not attempt to charge the battery at temperatures above\n+40 °C (+ 104 °F); at temperatures below +5°C (+41 °F), the\nbattery will not charge.\n\nTechnical\nNotes\n\nDo not attempt to recharge a fully charged battery. The battery\ndoes not however need to be fully discharged before charging.\n\n12\n\nThe Battery and Power Supply\n\nThe battery may be warm to the touch immediately after\ncharging or use. This is normal.\n\nBattery Life\n\nA noticeable decrease in the length of time the battery will\nhold a charge indicates that it has reached the end of its ser-\nvice life and should be replaced.\n\nStorage\n\nIf the camera will not be used for an extended period, store\nit at room temperature with the battery charged to approxi-\nmately one half to 2/3 capacity.\n\nIf the camera will not be used for an extended period, re-\nmove the battery and store it in a dry place with an ambient\ntemperature of from +15 °C to +25 °C (+59 °F to +77 °F). Do\nnot store in locations exposed to extremes of temperature.\n\nCautions: Handling the Battery\n\n- ● Do not transport or store with metal objects such as neck-\n- laces or hairpins.\n- ● Do not expose to flame or heat.\n- ● Do not disassemble or modify.\n- ● Do not expose to low atmospheric pressures.\n- ● Use with designated chargers only.\n- ● Dispose of used batteries promptly.\n- ● Do not drop or subject to strong physical shocks.\n- ● Do not expose to water.\n- ● Keep the terminals clean.\n- ● The battery and camera body may become warm to the\n- touch after extended use. This is normal.\n\n\nCaution: Disposal\n\nDispose of used batteries in accord with local regulations.\nAttention should be drawn to the environmental aspects of\nbattery disposal.
