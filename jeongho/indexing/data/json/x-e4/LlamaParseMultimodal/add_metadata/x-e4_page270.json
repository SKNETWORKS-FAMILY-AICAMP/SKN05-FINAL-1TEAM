Choose a shutter speed slower than the sync speed; even slower speeds may be required if the unit uses long flashes or has a slow response time. <br> • **OFF (OFF)**: The trigger signal is disabled. |\n| ② Sync                | Choose whether the flash is timed to fire immediately after the shutter opens (**1ST CURTAIN**) or immediately before it closes (**2ND CURTAIN**). **1ST CURTAIN** is recommended in most circumstances. |",
