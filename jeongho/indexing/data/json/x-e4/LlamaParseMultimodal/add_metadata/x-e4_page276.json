The options available vary with the shooting mode (**P, S, A,** or **M**) selected.                                                                                 |\n|                    | - **TTL (FLASH AUTO):** The flash fires only as required; flash level is adjusted according to subject brightness. A !Flash Icon icon displayed when the shutter button is pressed halfway indicates that the flash will fire when the photo is taken. |\n|                    | - **TTL (STANDARD):** The flash fires with every shot if possible; flash level is adjusted according to subject brightness. The flash will not fire if not fully charged when the shutter is released.          |\n|                    | - **TTL (SLOW SYNC.):** Combine the flash with slow shutter speeds when photographing portrait subjects against a backdrop of night scenery. The flash will not fire if not fully charged when the shutter is released. |\n| **8 Sync**         | Control flash timing.                                                                                                                                                                                          |\n|                    | - **1ST CURTAIN:** The flash fires immediately after the shutter opens (generally the best choice).                                                                                                           |\n|                    | - **2ND CURTAIN:** The flash fires immediately before the shutter closes.                                                                                                                                     |\n|                    | - **AUTO FP (HSS):** High-speed sync (compatible units only). The camera automatically engages front-curtain high-speed sync at shutter speeds faster than the flash sync speed. Equivalent to **1ST CURTAIN** when **MULTI** is selected for flash control mode. |\n| **9 Zoom**         | The angle of illumination (flash coverage) for units that support flash zoom. Some units allow the adjustment to be made from the camera. If **AUTO** is selected, zoom will automatically be adjusted to match coverage to lens focal length. |\n| **10 Lighting**    | If the unit supports this feature, choose from:                                                                                                                                                               |\n|                    | - **FLASH POWER PRIORITY:** Gain range by slightly reducing coverage.                                                                                                                                         |\n|                    | - **STANDARD:** Match coverage to picture angle.                                                                                                                                                              |\n|                    | - **EVEN COVERAGE PRIORITY:** Slightly increase coverage for more even lighting.                                                                                                                              |\n",
