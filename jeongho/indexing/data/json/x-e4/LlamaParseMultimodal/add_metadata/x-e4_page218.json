Choose this option in situations in which exposure and white balance are likely to change during shooting, as may be the case when you use a flash with an incandescent monitoring lamp. |\n| OFF           | Disable exposure and white balance preview. Choose this option when using a flash or on other occasions on which exposure may change when the picture is taken. |\n\n# NATURAL LIVE VIEW\n\nChoose whether the effects of film simulation, white balance, and other settings are visible in the monitor.\n\n| Option | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                 |\n|--------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| ON     | The effects of camera settings are not visible in the monitor, but shadows in low-contrast, back-lit scenes and other hard-to-see subjects more visible. Colors and tone will differ from those in the final picture. The display will however be adjusted to show the effects of monochrome and sepia settings. |\n| OFF    | The effects of film simulation, white balance, and other settings can be previewed in the monitor.                                                                                                           |\n",
