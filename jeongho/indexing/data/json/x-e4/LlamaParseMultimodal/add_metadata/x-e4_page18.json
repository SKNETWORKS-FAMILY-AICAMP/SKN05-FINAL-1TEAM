Note that the virtual horizon may not be displayed if the camera lens is pointed up or down. For a 3D display (shown), press the function button to which **ELECTRONIC LEVEL** is assigned.\n\n!Virtual Horizon Display\n\n## Framing Outline\n\nEnable **FRAMING OUTLINE** to make the borders of the frame easier to see against dark backgrounds.\n\n## Histograms\n\nHistograms show the distribution of tones in the image. Brightness is shown by the horizontal axis, the number of pixels by the vertical axis.\n\n!Histogram Display\n\n- **Optimal exposure:** Pixels are distributed in an even curve throughout the tone range.\n- **Overexposed:** Pixels are clustered on the right side of the graph.\n- **Underexposed:** Pixels are clustered on the left side of the graph.\n\nTo view separate RGB histograms and a display showing areas of the frame that will be overexposed at current settings superimposed on the view through the lens, press the function button to which **HISTOGRAM** is assigned.\n\n1. Overexposed areas blink\n2. RGB histograms\n\n!RGB Histogram Display",
