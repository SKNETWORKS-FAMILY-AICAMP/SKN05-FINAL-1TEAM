The options available vary with the shooting mode (**P, S, A,** or **M**) selected.  - **⚡AUTO (FLASH AUTO):** The flash fires only as required; flash level is adjusted according to subject brightness. A ⚡ icon displayed when the shutter button is pressed halfway indicates that the flash will fire when the photo is taken.  - **⚡TTL (STANDARD):** The flash fires with every shot if possible; flash level is adjusted according to subject brightness. The flash will not fire if not fully charged when the shutter is released.  - **⚡SLOW (SLOW SYNC.):** Combine the flash with slow shutter speeds when photographing portrait subjects against a backdrop of night scenery. The flash will not fire if not fully charged when the shutter is released. |\n| **④ Sync**       | Choose whether the flash is timed to fire immediately after the shutter opens (**FRONT/1ST CURTAIN**) or immediately before it closes (**REAR/2ND CURTAIN**). **1ST CURTAIN** is recommended in most circumstances. |\n",
