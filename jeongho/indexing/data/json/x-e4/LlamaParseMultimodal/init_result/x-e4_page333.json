Operation is subject to the following two conditions: (1) This device may not cause interference; and (2) This device must accept any interference, including interference that may cause undesired operation of the device.\n\nThis device and its antenna(s) must not be co-located or operating in conjunction with any other antenna or transmitter, except tested built-in radios. The County Code Selection feature is disabled for products marketed in the US/Canada.\n\n**Radiation Exposure Statement:**  \nThe available scientific evidence does not show that any health problems are associated with using low power wireless devices. There is no proof, however, that these low power wireless devices are absolutely safe. Low power Wireless devices emit low levels of radio frequency energy (RF) in the microwave range while being used. Whereas high levels of RF can produce health effects (by heating tissue), exposure of low-level RF that does not produce heating effects causes no known adverse health effects. Many studies of low-level RF exposures have not found any biological effects. Some studies have suggested that some biological effects might occur, but such findings have not been confirmed by additional research. X-E4 has been tested and found to comply with IC radiation exposure limits set forth for an uncontrolled environment and meets RSS-102 of the IC radio frequency (RF) Exposure rules.\n\n## Disposal of Electrical and Electronic Equipment in Private Households\n\n**In the European Union, Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein:**  \nThis symbol on the product, or in the manual and in the warranty, and/or on its packaging indicates that this product shall not be treated as household waste. Instead, it should be taken to an applicable collection point for the recycling of electrical and electronic equipment.\n\nBy ensuring this product is disposed of correctly, you will help prevent potential negative consequences to the environment and human health, which could otherwise be caused by inappropriate waste handling of this product.\n\nThis symbol on the batteries or accumulators indicates that those batteries shall not be treated as household waste.\n\nIf your equipment contains easy removable batteries or accumulators please dispose these separately according to your local requirements.\n\nThe recycling of materials will help to conserve natural resources. For more detailed information about recycling this product, please contact your local city office, your household waste disposal service or the shop where you purchased the product.\n\n**In Countries Outside the European Union, Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein:**  \nIf you wish to discard this product, including the batteries or accumulators, please contact your local authorities and ask for the correct way of disposal.\n\n**In Japan:**  \nThis symbol on the batteries indicates that they are to be disposed of separately.\n\n!Recycling Symbols\n\n## Caring for the Camera\n\nTo ensure continued enjoyment of the product, observe the following precautions.\n\n### Storage and Use\n\nIf the camera will not be used for an extended period, remove the battery and memory card. Do not store or use the camera in locations that are:\n\n- exposed to rain, steam, or smoke\n- very humid or extremely dusty\n- exposed to direct sunlight or very high temperatures, such as in a closed vehicle on a sunny day\n- extremely cold\n- subject to strong vibration\n- exposed to strong magnetic fields, such as near a broadcasting antenna, power line, radar emitter, motor, transformer, or magnet\n- in contact with volatile chemicals such as pesticides\n- next to rubber or vinyl products",
