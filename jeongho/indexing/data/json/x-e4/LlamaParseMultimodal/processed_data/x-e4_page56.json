    "parsing_result": "# P, S, A, and M Modes\n\nP, S, A, and M modes give you varying degrees of control over shutter speed and aperture.\n\n## Mode P: Program AE\n\nLet the camera choose shutter speed and aperture for optimal exposure. Other values that produce the same exposure can be selected with program shift.\n\nThe camera functions in mode P (program AE) when the shutter speed dial is rotated to **A** or **P**. Aperture is set as follows.\n\n| Shutter speed dial | Aperture |\n|--------------------|----------|\n| !P Mode Dial | The camera functions in mode **P** regardless of the option selected for aperture. |\n| !A Mode Dial | - **Lenses with aperture rings:** Mode **P** can be selected by rotating the ring to **A** (auto).<br>- **Lenses without aperture rings:** Mode **P** can be selected by pressing the center of the front command dial to cycle to **APERTURE** and then rotating the dial to choose **A** (auto). |\n\n> ðŸ’¡ **Note:**\n> - The method for adjusting aperture when using a lens without an aperture ring can be chosen using **BUTTON/DIAL SETTING > APERTURE SETTING**.\n> - Front command dial settings can be adjusted using **BUTTON/DIAL SETTING > COMMAND DIAL SETTING**.",
