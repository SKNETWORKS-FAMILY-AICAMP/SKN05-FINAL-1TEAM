    "parsing_result": "## Movie Recording and Playback\n\n- Use a memory card with a UHS speed class of 3 or better when recording movies.\n- Sound is recorded via the built-in microphone or an optional external microphone. Do not cover the microphone during recording.\n- Note that the microphone may pick up lens noise and other sounds made by the camera during recording.\n- Vertical or horizontal streaks may appear in movies containing very bright subjects. This is normal and does not indicate a malfunction.\n- The temperature of the camera may rise depending on ambient temperature and length of use. The back of the camera and the area around the back of the LCD monitor in particular may become hot when the monitor is tilted; precaution is advised.\n\n!Camera Diagram\n\n- The indicator lamp lights while recording is in progress.\n- In the case of zoom lenses, zoom can be adjusted during recording using the zoom ring (if available).\n- Exposure compensation can be adjusted during recording, but only by a maximum of Â±2 EV.\n- Recording may be unavailable at some settings, while in other cases settings may not apply during recording.\n- Headphones connected via USB can be used to monitor audio during movie recording. Use the supplied headphone adapter to convert the USB connector to a plug for a headphone jack.\n\n### Using an External Microphone\n\nSound can be recorded with external microphones that connect using jacks 3.5 mm in diameter; microphones that require plug-in power cannot be used. See the microphone manual for details.\n\n!External Microphone Connection",
