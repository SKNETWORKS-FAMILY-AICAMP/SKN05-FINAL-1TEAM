You can also choose whether the camera focuses on the left or right eye when face detection is on.\n\n!Face Detection Example\n\n| Option               | Description                                                                                                                                   |\n|----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| **FACE DETECTION ON**| Adjust settings for Intelligent Face Detection.
