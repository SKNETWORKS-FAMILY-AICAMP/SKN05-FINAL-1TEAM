Sensitivity is restricted to values between ISO 640 and ISO 12800 (**F-Log**) or between ISO 1250 and ISO 12800 (**FLog2**).\n- The **HLG** (Hybrid Log-Gamma) recording format conforms to the international ITU-R BT2100 standard. When viewed on HLG-compatible displays, high-quality HLG footage faithfully captures high-contrast scenes and vivid colors. Sensitivity is restricted to values between ISO 1000 and ISO 12800.\n- Film simulation ( !Film Simulation Icon ) footage is recorded using the option selected for !Image Quality Setting Icon **IMAGE QUALITY SETTING** > !Film Simulation Icon **FILM SIMULATION** in the shooting menu.",
