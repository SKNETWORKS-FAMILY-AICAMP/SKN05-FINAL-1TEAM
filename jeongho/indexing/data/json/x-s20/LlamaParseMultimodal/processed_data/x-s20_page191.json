Footage is recorded at a depth of 8 bits using All-I interframe compression and 4:2:0 chroma sub-sampling. |\n| **H.264 LongGOP 420 MOV**    | A highly-portable compressed format. Footage is recorded at a depth of 8 bits using Long GOP interframe compression and 4:2:0 chroma sub-sampling. |\n| **H.264 LongGOP 420 MP4**    | A format suitable for movies that will be uploaded to the web.                                                                                  |\n| **H.265 ALL-I 420 MOV**      | A format with a higher compression ratio than H.264. Footage is recorded at a depth of 10 bits using All-I interframe compression and 4:2:0 chroma sub-sampling. |\n| **H.265 LongGOP 420 MOV**    | A format with a higher compression ratio than H.264. Footage is recorded at a depth of 10 bits using Long GOP interframe compression and 4:2:0 chroma sub-sampling. |\n| **H.265 ALL-I 422 MOV**      | A format with a higher compression ratio than H.264. Footage is recorded at a depth of 10 bits using All-I interframe compression and 4:2:2 chroma sub-sampling. |\n| **H.265 LongGOP 422 MOV**    | A format with a higher compression ratio than H.264. Footage is recorded at a depth of 10 bits using Long GOP interframe compression and 4:2:2 chroma sub-sampling. |\n\n> ðŸ’¡ **Note:**\n> - **4:2:2 chroma sub-sampling** is used for footage output to external devices connected via HDMI; H.264 footage is output at a bit depth of 8 bits and footage in other formats at a depth of 10 bits.\n> - **All-I** compresses each frame separately. Files are larger, but the fact that the data for each frame are saved separately makes this a good choice for footage that will be further processed.\n> - **Long GOP** balances good image quality with high compression. Files are smaller, making it a good choice for longer movies.\n> - The options available for file type and compression vary with the options selected for **MOVIE MODE, HIGH SPEED REC,** and **F-Log/HLG RECORDING**.",
