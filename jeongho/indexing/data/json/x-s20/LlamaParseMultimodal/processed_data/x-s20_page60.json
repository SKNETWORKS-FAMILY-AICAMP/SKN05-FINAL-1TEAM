Do not cover the microphone during recording.\n  - Note that the microphone may pick up lens noise and other sounds made by the camera during recording.\n  - Vertical or horizontal streaks may appear in movies containing very bright subjects. This is normal and does not indicate a malfunction.\n\n- **Maximizing Recording Time:**\n  - Keep the camera out of direct sunlight as much as possible.\n  - Turn the camera off any time it is not in use.\n\n- **Indicator Lamp:**\n  - The indicator lamp lights while recording is in progress. The **MOVIE SETTING > TALLY LIGHT** option can be used to choose the lamp—indicator or AF-assist—that lights during movie recording and whether the lamp blinks or remains steady.\n  - During recording, you can change exposure compensation by up to ±2 EV and adjust zoom using the zoom ring on the lens (if available).\n\n- **Display Borders:**\n  - To prevent the borders of the display changing color during movie recording, select **OFF** for **MOVIE SETTING > REC FRAME INDICATOR**.\n\n- **While Recording:**\n  - Adjust sensitivity.\n  - Refocus using any of the following methods:\n    - Press the shutter button halfway.\n    - Press a function button to which **AF-ON** is assigned.\n    - Use touch screen controls.\n  - Display a histogram or artificial horizon by pressing the button to which **HISTOGRAM** or **ELECTRONIC LEVEL SWITCH** has been assigned.\n\n- **Recording Availability:**\n  - Recording may be unavailable at some settings, while in other cases settings may not apply during recording.\n\n- **Focus Area:**\n  - To choose the focus area for movie recording, select **AF/MF SETTING > FOCUS AREA** and use the focus stick (focus lever) and rear command dial.",
