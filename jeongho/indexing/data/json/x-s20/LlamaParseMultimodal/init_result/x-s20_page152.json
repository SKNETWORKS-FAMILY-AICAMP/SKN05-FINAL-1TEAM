The options available vary with the shooting mode (**P, S, A,** or **M**) selected.                                                                                 |\n|                     | - **FLASH AUTO**: The flash fires only as required; flash level is adjusted according to subject brightness. A flash icon is displayed when the shutter button is pressed halfway, indicating the flash will fire when the photo is taken. |\n|                     | - **STANDARD**: The flash fires with every shot if possible; flash level is adjusted according to subject brightness. The flash will not fire if not fully charged when the shutter is released.               |\n|                     | - **SLOW SYNC.**: Combine the flash with slow shutter speeds when photographing portrait subjects against a backdrop of night scenery. The flash will not fire if not fully charged when the shutter is released. |\n| **Sync**            | Choose whether the flash is timed to fire immediately after the shutter opens (**1ST CURTAIN**) or immediately before it closes (**2ND CURTAIN**). **1ST CURTAIN** is recommended in most circumstances.     |\n\n## Red-Eye Removal\nRed-eye removal is available when **FLASH** is selected for **FLASH SETTING > RED EYE REMOVAL**. Red-eye removal minimizes \"red-eye\" caused when light from the flash is reflected from the subject’s retinas.\n\n## Flash Sync Speed\nThe flash will synchronize with the shutter at shutter speeds of 1/180 s or slower.\n\n## Optional Flash Units from Fujifilm\nThe camera can be used with optional Fujifilm shoe-mounted flash units.\n\n## Third-Party Flash Units\nDo not use third-party flash units that apply over 300 V to the camera hot shoe.\n",
