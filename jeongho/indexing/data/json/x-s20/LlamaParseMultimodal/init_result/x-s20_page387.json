See:  \nhttp://www.dtsc.ca.gov/hazardouswaste/perchlorate\n\n## For Customers in the U.S.A.\n\n### Tested To Comply With FCC Standards  \nFOR HOME OR OFFICE USE\n\n!FCC Logo\n\nContains IC: 10293A-WMBACBM25  \nContains FCC ID: COF-WMBACBM25\n\n### FCC Statement\nThis device complies with Part 15 of the FCC Rules. Operation is subject to the following two conditions:  \n1. This device may not cause harmful interference, and  \n2. This device must accept any interference received, including interference that may cause undesired operation.\n\n**CAUTION:** This equipment has been tested and found to comply with the limits for a Class B digital device, pursuant to Part 15 of the FCC Rules. These limits are designed to provide reasonable protection against harmful interference in a residential installation. This equipment generates, uses, and can radiate radio frequency energy and, if not installed and used in accordance with the instructions, may cause harmful interference to radio communications. However, there is no guarantee that interference will not occur in a particular installation. If this equipment does cause harmful interference to radio or television reception, which can be determined by turning the equipment off and on, the user is encouraged to try to correct the interference by one or more of the following measures:\n- Reorient or relocate the receiving antenna.\n- Increase the separation between the equipment and receiver.\n- Connect the equipment into an outlet on a circuit different from that to which the receiver is connected.\n- Consult the dealer or an experienced radio/TV technician for help.\n\n**FCC Caution:** Any changes or modifications not expressly approved by the party responsible for compliance could void the user's authority to operate this equipment.\n\nThis transmitter must not be co-located or operating in conjunction with any other antenna or transmitter.\n\n### Radiation Exposure Statement\nThis device meets the government’s requirements for exposure to radio waves. This device is designed and manufactured not to exceed the emission limits for exposure to radio frequency (RF) energy set by the Federal Communications Commission of the U.S. Government.\n\nThe exposure standard for wireless devices employs a unit of measurement known as the Specific Absorption Rate, or SAR. The SAR limit set by the FCC is 1.6W/kg. Tests for SAR are conducted using standard operating positions accepted by the FCC with the device transmitting at its highest certified power level in all tested frequency bands.\n\n### Notes on the Grant\nTo comply with Part 15 of the FCC Rules, this product must be used with a Fujifilm-specified ferrite-core A/V cable, USB cable, and DC supply cord.\n\n!Battery Recycling Information\n\nA lithium ion battery that is recyclable powers the product you have purchased. Please call 1-800-8-BATTERY for information on how to recycle this battery.\n\n### California Code of Regulations\nTitle 20, Division 2, Chapter 4, Article 4, Appliance Efficiency Regulations, Sections 1601 through 1609",
