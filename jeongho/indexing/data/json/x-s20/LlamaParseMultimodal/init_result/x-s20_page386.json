Failure to observe this precaution could damage the camera image sensor.\n- Strong sunlight focused through the viewfinder may damage the panel of electronic viewfinder (EVF). Do not aim the electronic viewfinder at the sun.\n\n## Take Test Shots\nBefore taking photographs on important occasions (such as at weddings or before taking the camera on a trip), take a test shot and view the results to ensure that the camera is functioning normally. FUJIFILM Corporation cannot accept liability for damages or lost profits incurred as a result of product malfunction.\n\n## Notes on Copyright\nUnless intended solely for personal use, images recorded using your digital camera system cannot be used in ways that infringe copyright laws without the consent of the owner. Note that some restrictions apply to the photographing of stage performances, entertainments, and exhibits, even when intended purely for personal use. Users are also asked to note that the transfer of memory cards containing images or data protected under copyright laws is only permissible within the restrictions imposed by those copyright laws.\n\n## Handling\nTo ensure that images are recorded correctly, do not subject the camera to impact or physical shocks while images are being recorded.\n\n## Liquid Crystal\nIn the event that the display is damaged, care should be taken to avoid contact with liquid crystal. Take the urgent action indicated should any of the following situations arise:\n- **If liquid crystal comes in contact with your skin**, clean the area with a cloth and then wash thoroughly with soap and running water.\n- **If liquid crystal enters your eyes**, flush the affected eye with clean water for at least 15 minutes and then seek medical assistance.\n- **If liquid crystal is swallowed**, rinse your mouth thoroughly with water. Drink large quantities of water and induce vomiting, then seek medical assistance.\n\nAlthough the display is manufactured using extremely high-precision technology, it may contain pixels that are always lit or that do not light. This is not a malfunction, and images recorded with the product are unaffected.\n\n## Trademark Information\nDigital Split Image is a trademark or registered trademark of FUJIFILM Corporation.
