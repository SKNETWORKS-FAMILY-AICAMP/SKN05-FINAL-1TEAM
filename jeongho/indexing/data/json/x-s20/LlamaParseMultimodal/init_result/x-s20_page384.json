This can cause a fire.\n\n- **Do not place heavy objects on the camera.** This can cause the heavy object to tip over or fall and cause injury.\n\n- **Do not move the camera while the AC power adapter is still connected.** Do not pull on the connection cord to disconnect the AC power adapter. This can damage the power cord or cables and cause a fire or electric shock.\n\n- **Do not cover or wrap the camera or the AC power adapter in a cloth or blanket.** This can cause heat to build up and distort the casing or cause a fire.\n\n- **Do not use the plug if it is damaged or if it does not fit securely into the outlet.** Failure to observe this precaution could result in fire or electric shock.\n\n- **When you are cleaning the camera or you do not plan to use the camera for an extended period, remove the battery and disconnect and unplug the AC power adapter.** Failure to do so can cause a fire or electric shock.\n\n- **When charging ends, unplug the charger from the power socket.** Leaving the charger plugged into the power socket can cause a fire.\n\n- **When a memory card is removed, the card could come out of the slot too quickly. Use your finger to hold it and gently release the card.** Injury could result to those struck by the ejected card.\n\n- **Do not handle the memory card immediately after shooting.** The memory card may be hot, resulting in burns. Wait for the card to cool before removing it from the camera.\n\n- **Request regular internal testing and cleaning for your camera.** Buildup of dust in your camera can cause a fire or electric shock. Contact your Fujifilm dealer to request internal cleaning every two years. Please note that this service is not free of charge.\n\n- **Dispose of the product in accord with location regulations.**\n\n- **Danger of explosion if battery is incorrectly replaced. Replace only with the same or equivalent type.**\n\n- **Batteries (battery pack or batteries installed) shall not be exposed to excessive heat such as sunshine, fire or the like.**\n",
