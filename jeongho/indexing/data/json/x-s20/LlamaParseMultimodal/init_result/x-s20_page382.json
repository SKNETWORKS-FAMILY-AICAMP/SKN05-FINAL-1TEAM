Extreme care should be taken to avoid contact with power lines, as it might be fatal.\n\n## Use\n\n### Cleaning\nUnplug this video product from the wall outlet before cleaning. Do not use liquid cleaners or aerosol cleaners. Use a damp cloth for cleaning.\n\n### Object and Liquid Entry\nNever push objects into this video product through openings, as they may touch dangerous voltage points or short out parts that could result in a fire or electric shock. Never spill liquid of any kind on the video product.\n\n### Lightning\nFor added protection during a lightning storm, or when left unattended and unused for long periods, unplug it from the wall outlet and disconnect the antenna or cable system. This will prevent damage due to lightning and power-line surges.\n\n## Service\n\n### Servicing\nDo not attempt to service this video product yourself, as opening or removing covers may expose you to dangerous voltage or other hazards. Refer all servicing to qualified service personnel.\n\n### Damage Requiring Service\nUnplug this video product and refer servicing to qualified service personnel under the following conditions:\n- When the power-supply cord or plug is damaged.\n- If liquid has been spilled, or objects have fallen into the video product.\n- If the video product has been exposed to rain or water.\n- If the video product has been dropped or the cabinet has been damaged.\n- If the video product does not operate normally, follow the operating instructions. Adjust only those controls covered by the operating instructions, as improper adjustment may result in damage and often require extensive work by a qualified technician.\n- When the video product exhibits a distinct change in performance—this indicates a need for service.\n\n### Replacement Parts\nWhen replacement parts are required, ensure the service technician uses parts specified by the manufacturer or with the same characteristics as the original part. Unauthorized substitutions may result in fire, electric shock, or other hazards.\n\n### Safety Check\nUpon completion of any service or repairs, ask the service technician to perform safety checks to ensure the video product is in proper operating condition.\n\n----\n\n## Safety Notes\n\n- Make sure that you use your camera correctly. Read these safety notes and your Basic Manual carefully before use.\n- After reading these safety notes, store them in a safe place.\n\n## About the Icons\n\nThe icons in this document indicate the severity of injury or damage that can result if the information is ignored and the product is used incorrectly.\n\n- **Warning**: Indicates that death or serious injury can result if the information is ignored.\n- **Caution**: Indicates that personal injury or material damage can result if the information is ignored.\n\n### Icon Types\n\n- Triangular icons: Require attention (\"Important\").\n- Circular icons with a diagonal bar: Indicate prohibited actions (\"Prohibited\").\n- Filled circles with an exclamation mark: Indicate required actions (\"Required\").\n\n## Symbols on the Product\n\n- **AC**: Alternating Current\n- **DC**: Direct Current\n- **Class II equipment**: The construction of the product is double-insulated.\n\n----\n\n### Warning\n\nIf a problem arises, turn the camera off, remove the battery, disconnect the USB cable, and unplug the AC power adapter. Continued use when emitting smoke, unusual odor, or in any abnormal state can cause a fire or electric shock. Contact your Fujifilm dealer.\n\nDo not allow water or foreign objects to enter the camera or connecting cables. Do not use the camera or cables following ingress of fresh or salt water, milk, beverages, detergents, or other liquids. If liquid enters, turn off the camera, remove the battery, disconnect the USB cable, and unplug the AC adapter. Continued use can cause a fire or electric shock. Contact your Fujifilm dealer.",
