Both the UHS-I and UHS-II bus interfaces are supported.\n- UHS-II cards are recommended for high-speed burst photography.\n- The types of memory cards suitable for movie recording vary with the settings selected (ðŸ“– 68).\n- A list of supported memory cards is available on the Fujifilm website. For details, visit:  \n  https://fujifilm-x.com/support/compatibility/cameras/.\n\n### Important Notes\n\n- *Do not turn the camera off or remove the memory card while the memory card is being formatted or data are being recorded to or deleted from the card.* Failure to observe this precaution could damage the card.\n- Memory cards can be locked, making it impossible to format the card or to record or delete images. Before inserting a memory card, slide the write-protect switch to the unlocked position.\n- Memory cards are small and can be swallowed; keep out of reach of children. If a child swallows a memory card, seek medical assistance immediately.\n- miniSD or microSD adapters that are larger or smaller than memory cards may not eject normally; if the card does not eject, take the camera to an authorized service representative. Do not forcibly remove the card.\n- Do not affix labels or other objects to memory cards. Peeling labels can cause camera malfunction.\n- Movie recording may be interrupted with some types of memory card.\n- Formatting a memory card in the camera creates a folder in which pictures are stored. Do not rename or delete this folder or use a computer or other device to edit, delete, or rename image files. Always use the camera to delete pictures; before editing or renaming files, copy them to a computer and edit or rename the copies, not the originals. Renaming the files on the camera can cause problems during playback.\n\n!Memory Card Lock Diagram",
