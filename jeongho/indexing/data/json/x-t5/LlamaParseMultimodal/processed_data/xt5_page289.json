For information on using cinema lenses, see the documentation provided with the lens.\n\n| Option   | Description |\n|----------|-------------|\n| T NUMBER | A measure of lens aperture commonly used by cinematographers. Lens transmittance is taken into account to better calculate exposure. |\n| F NUMBER | A measure of lens aperture commonly used by photographers. Lens transmittance is assumed to be 100%, meaning that the same aperture may produce different exposures depending on the lens. |",
