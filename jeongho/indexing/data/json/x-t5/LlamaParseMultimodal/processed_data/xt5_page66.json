    "parsing_result": "## Movie Recording and Playback\n\n- **Sound Recording:**\n  - Sound is recorded via the built-in microphone or an optional external microphone. Do not cover the microphone during recording.\n  - Note that the microphone may pick up lens noise and other sounds made by the camera during recording.\n  - Vertical or horizontal streaks may appear in movies containing very bright subjects. This is normal and does not indicate a malfunction.\n\n- **Monitoring Audio:**\n  - To monitor audio with headphones during recording, you will need to convert the USB connector to an audio jack using the supplied headphone adapter.\n  - The indicator lamp lights while recording is in progress (the `MOVIE SETTING > TALLY LIGHT` option can be used to choose the lamp—indicator or AF-assist—that lights during movie recording and whether the lamp blinks or remains steady).\n  - During recording, you can change exposure compensation by up to ±2 EV and adjust zoom using the zoom ring on the lens (if available).\n\n- **Display Settings:**\n  - To prevent the borders of the display changing color during movie recording, select `OFF` for `MOVIE SETTING > REC FRAME INDICATOR`.\n\n- **While Recording:**\n  - Adjust sensitivity.\n  - Refocus using any of the following methods:\n    - Press the shutter button halfway.\n    - Press a function button to which `AF-ON` is assigned.\n    - Use touch screen controls.\n  - Display a histogram or artificial horizon by pressing the button to which `HISTOGRAM` or `ELECTRONIC LEVEL SWITCH` has been assigned.\n\n- **Recording Availability:**\n  - Recording may be unavailable at some settings, while in other cases settings may not apply during recording.\n\n- **Focus Area:**\n  - To choose the focus area for movie recording, select `AF/MF SETTING > FOCUS AREA` and use the focus stick (focus lever) and rear command dial (page 87).",
