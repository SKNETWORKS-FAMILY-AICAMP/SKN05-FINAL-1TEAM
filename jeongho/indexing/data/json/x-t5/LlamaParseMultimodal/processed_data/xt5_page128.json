A white balance target will be displayed; position and size the target so that it is filled by the reference object and press the shutter button all the way down to measure white balance (to select the most recent custom value and exit without measuring white balance, press `DISP/BACK`, or press `MENU/OK` to select the most recent value and display the fine-tuning dialog).\n\n!Custom White Balance Screen\n\n- If “COMPLETED!” is displayed, press `MENU/OK` to set white balance to the measured value.\n- If “UNDER” is displayed, raise exposure compensation and try again.\n- If “OVER” is displayed, lower exposure compensation and try again.\n\n## K: Color Temperature\n\nAdjust white balance to match the color temperature of the light source.\n\n!Color Temperature Note\n\n> Color temperature can be adjusted to make pictures “warmer” or “colder” or deliberately produce colors that differ radically from those in real life.",
