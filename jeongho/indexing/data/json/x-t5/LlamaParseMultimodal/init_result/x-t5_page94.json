Regardless of the option selected, the camera will automatically switch to **C** when **FACE DETECTION ON** or **SUBJECT DETECTION ON** is chosen for **AF/MF SETTING > FACE/EYE DETECTION SETTING** or **SUBJECT DETECTION SETTING**. Note, however, that choosing **M** when **FACE DETECTION ON** or **SUBJECT DETECTION ON** is selected disables face and subject detection.\n\n> ðŸ’¡ **Note:**\n> - Changes made using the !Movie Setting Icon **MOVIE SETTING** item in the photo menus also apply to the movie menus.
