Sensitivity is restricted to values between ISO 400 and ISO 12800 (**F-Log**) or between ISO 800 and ISO 12800 (**FLog2**).\n> - The **HLG** (Hybrid Log-Gamma) recording format conforms to the international ITU-R BT2100 standard. When viewed on HLG-compatible displays, high-quality HLG footage faithfully captures high-contrast scenes and vivid colors.
