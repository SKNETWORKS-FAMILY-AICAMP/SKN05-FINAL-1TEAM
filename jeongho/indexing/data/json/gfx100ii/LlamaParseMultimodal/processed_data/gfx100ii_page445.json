Pixel mapping helps reduce the occurrence of such bright spots. <br> - The camera has been used continuously at high temperatures: Turn the camera off and wait for it to cool down (ðŸ“– 54, 456). <br> - A temperature warning is displayed: Turn the camera off and wait for it to cool down (ðŸ“– 54, 456). |",
