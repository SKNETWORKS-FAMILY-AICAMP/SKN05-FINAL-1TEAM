Be sure that the option selected in the camera menus overlaps with that chosen with the lens.\n\n> ðŸ’¡ **Additional Operations:**\n> - When **CUSTOM** is selected:\n>   - You can tap objects in the touch screen display to choose the focus range.\n>   - Instead of tapping an object in the display, you set the maximum focus distance to infinity by rotating the focus ring.\n> - Any changes made using this item also apply in movie mode.",
