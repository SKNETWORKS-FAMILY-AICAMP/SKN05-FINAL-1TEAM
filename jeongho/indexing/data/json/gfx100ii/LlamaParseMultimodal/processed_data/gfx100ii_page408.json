The options available vary with the shooting mode (**P, S, A,** or **M**) selected. <br> • **TTL (FLASH AUTO):** The flash fires only as required; flash level is adjusted according to subject brightness. A !Flash Icon icon displayed when the shutter button is pressed halfway indicates that the flash will fire when the photo is taken. <br> • **TTL (STANDARD):** The flash fires with every shot if possible; flash level is adjusted according to subject brightness. The flash will not fire if not fully charged when the shutter is released. <br> • **TTL (SLOW SYNC.):** Combine the flash with slow shutter speeds when photographing portrait subjects against a backdrop of night scenery. The flash will not fire if not fully charged when the shutter is released. |\n| **8 Sync**       | Control flash timing. <br> • **1ST CURTAIN:** The flash fires immediately after the shutter opens (generally the best choice). <br> • **2ND CURTAIN:** The flash fires immediately before the shutter closes. <br> • **AUTO FP (HSS):** High-speed sync (compatible units only). The camera automatically engages front-curtain high-speed sync at shutter speeds faster than the flash sync speed. Equivalent to **1ST CURTAIN** when **MULTI** is selected for flash control mode. |\n| **9 Zoom**       | The angle of illumination (flash coverage) for units that support flash zoom. Some units allow the adjustment to be made from the camera. If **AUTO** is selected, zoom will automatically be adjusted to match coverage to lens focal length.                                                                                                                                       |\n| **10 Lighting**  | If the unit supports this feature, choose from: <br> • **FLASH POWER PRIORITY:** Gain range by slightly reducing coverage. <br> • **STANDARD:** Match coverage to picture angle. <br> • **EVEN COVERAGE PRIORITY:** Slightly increase coverage for more even lighting.                                                                                                           |\n",
