    "parsing_result": "# The Battery and Power Supply\n\n> **Note:** Check the type of battery used in your camera and read the appropriate sections.\n\n### ⚠️ WARNING:\nBattery shall not be exposed to excessive heat such as sunshine, fire or the like.\n\nThe following describes the proper use of batteries and how to prolong their life. Incorrect use can shorten battery life or cause leakage, overheating, fire, or explosion.\n\n## Li-ion Batteries\nRead this section if your camera uses a rechargeable Li-ion battery.\n\nThe battery is not charged at shipment. Charge the battery before use. Keep the battery in its case when not in use.\n\n### Notes on the Battery\n- The battery gradually loses its charge when not in use. Charge the battery one or two days before use.\n- Battery life can be extended by turning the camera off when not in use.\n- Battery capacity decreases at low temperatures; a depleted battery may not function when cold. Keep a fully charged spare battery in a warm place and exchange as necessary, or keep the battery in your pocket or other warm place and insert it in the camera only when shooting. Do not place the battery in direct contact with hand warmers or other heating devices.\n\n### Charging the Battery\n- The battery can be charged using the camera and supplied AC adapter or an optional BC-W235 dual battery charger.\n- Charging times will increase at ambient temperatures below +10°C (+50°F) or above +35°C (+95°F). Do not attempt to charge the battery at temperatures above +40°C (+104°F); at temperatures below +5°C (+41°F), the battery will not charge.\n- Do not attempt to recharge a fully charged battery. The battery does not need to be fully discharged before charging.\n- The battery may be warm to the touch immediately after charging or use. This is normal.\n\n### Battery Life\n- A noticeable decrease in the length of time the battery will hold a charge indicates that it has reached the end of its service life and should be replaced.\n- If the battery is left for long periods without charging, you may find that its quality degrades or that it no longer holds a charge. Charge the battery regularly.\n\n### Storage\n- If the camera will not be used for an extended period, store it at room temperature with the battery charged to approximately one half to ⅔ capacity.\n- If the camera will not be used for an extended period, remove the battery and store it in a dry place with an ambient temperature of from +15°C to +25°C (+59°F to +77°F). Do not store in locations exposed to extremes of temperature.\n\n## Cautions: Handling the Battery\n- Do not transport or store with metal objects such as necklaces or hairpins.\n- Do not expose to flame or heat.\n- Do not disassemble or modify.\n- Do not expose to low atmospheric pressures.\n- Use with designated chargers only.\n- Dispose of used batteries promptly.\n- Do not drop or subject to strong physical shocks.\n- Do not expose to water.\n- Keep the terminals clean.\n- The battery and camera body may become warm to the touch after extended use. This is normal.\n\n## Caution: Disposal\n- Dispose of used batteries in accord with local regulations. Attention should be drawn to the environmental aspects of battery disposal. Use the apparatus under moderate climate.\n- Do not mechanically crush or split batteries.\n\n## AC Power Adapters\n- The AC power adapter is for indoor use only.\n- Be sure the cable is securely connected to the camera.\n- Turn the camera off before disconnecting the adapter. Disconnect the adapter by the plug, not the cable.\n- Do not disassemble.\n- Do not expose to high heat and humidity.\n- Do not subject to strong physical shocks.\n- The adapter may hum or become hot to the touch during use. This is normal.\n- If the adapter causes radio interference, reorient or relocate the receiving antenna.",
