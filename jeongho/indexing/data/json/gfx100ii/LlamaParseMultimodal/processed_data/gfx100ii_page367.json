The battery drains faster than when **NORMAL** is selected. You can choose to assign priority to: <ul><li>**AF PRIORITY - NORMAL**: Focus speed.</li><li>**AF PRIORITY - LOW LIGHT**: Focus speed while adjusting EVF and LCD brightness to make objects in shadows easier to see. Some ghosting may be visible with blurred images.</li><li>**EVF RESOLUTION PRIORITY**: Viewfinder resolution.</li><li>**EVF FRAME RATE PRIORITY (120P)**: The refresh rate for the EVF is increased, smoothing motion.</li><li>**EVF FRAME RATE PRIORITY (240P EQUIV.)**: The refresh rate for the EVF is increased beyond **EVF FRAME RATE PRIORITY (120P)** smoothing motion still further. The EVF may darken.</li></ul><ul><li>Regardless of the option selected, the camera functions in **AF PRIORITY - NORMAL** mode while the monitor is on.</li><li>The **SCREEN SET-UP > EVF FULL SCREEN MAGNIFICATION** setting cannot be changed when either **EVF FRAME RATE PRIORITY (120P)** or **EVF FRAME RATE PRIORITY (240P EQUIV.)** is set. With these settings, the screen magnification is set to 0.77x.</li></ul> |\n| NORMAL | Choose for standard focus and EVF display performance and battery endurance. |",
