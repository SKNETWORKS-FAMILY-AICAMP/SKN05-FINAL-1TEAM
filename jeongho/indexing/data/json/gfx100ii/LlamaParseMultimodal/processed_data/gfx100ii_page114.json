The camera will take the specified number of shots in sequence: one using the metered value for exposure and the others over- or under-exposed by multiples of the selected bracketing amount.\n\n> ðŸ’¡ **Note:**  \n> Regardless of the bracketing amount, exposure will not exceed the limits of the exposure metering system.\n\n## FILM SIMULATION BKT\nEach time the shutter is released, the camera takes one shot and processes it to create copies with different film simulation settings, chosen using **SHOOTING SETTING > FILM SIMULATION BKT**.\n\n## DYNAMIC RANGE BKT\nEach time the shutter button is pressed, the camera takes three shots with different dynamic ranges: 100% for the first, 200% for the second, and 400% for the third.\n\n> ðŸ’¡ **Note:**  \n> While dynamic range bracketing is in effect, sensitivity will be restricted to a minimum of ISO 320; the sensitivity previously in effect is restored when bracketing ends.",
