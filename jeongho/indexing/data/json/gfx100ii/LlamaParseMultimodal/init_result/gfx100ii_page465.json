Do not use alcohol, thinner, or other volatile chemicals, which could discolor or deform the leather on the camera body. Any liquid on the camera should be removed immediately with a soft, dry cloth. Use a blower to remove dust from the monitor, taking care to avoid scratches, and then gently wipe with a soft, dry cloth. Any remaining stains can be removed by wiping gently with a piece of Fujifilm lens-cleaning paper to which a small amount of lens-cleaning fluid has been applied. To prevent dust entering the camera, replace the body cap when no lens is in place.\n\n## Image Sensor\n\nMultiple photographs marred by spots or blotches in identical locations may indicate the presence of dust on the image sensor. Clean the sensor using **USER SETTING > SENSOR CLEANING**.",
