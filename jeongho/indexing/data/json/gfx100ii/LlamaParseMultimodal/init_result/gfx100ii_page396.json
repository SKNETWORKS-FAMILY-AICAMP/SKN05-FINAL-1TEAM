Choose the temperature at which the camera turns off automatically.\n\n| Option    | Description |\n|-----------|-------------|\n| STANDARD  | The camera turns off automatically when its temperature reaches the **STANDARD** value. |\n| HIGH      | Shooting can continue at temperatures higher than the **STANDARD** value, extending the time available to record movies and the like. Because remaining in contact with the camera at these high temperatures could result in low-temperature burns, this option should only be used after mounting the camera on a tripod or taking other steps to avoid prolonged contact with the camera. |",
