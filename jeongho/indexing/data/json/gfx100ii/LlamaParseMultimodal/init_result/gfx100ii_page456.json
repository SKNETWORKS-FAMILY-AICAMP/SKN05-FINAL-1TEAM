Remove the battery immediately, taking care to avoid injury or electric shock, and take the product to the point of purchase for consultation.\n\n### Do not change, heat or unduly twist or pull the connection cord and do not place heavy objects on the connection cord.\nThese actions could damage the cord and cause a fire or electric shock. If the cord is damaged, contact your Fujifilm dealer. Do not use cables with bent connectors.\n\n### Do not place the camera on an unstable surface.\nThis can cause the camera to fall or tip over and cause injury.\n\n### Never attempt to take pictures while in motion.\nDo not use shooting, playback, or any other operations of the camera while operating a car or other vehicle. This can result in you falling down or being involved in a traffic accident. If you take pictures while walking, pay attention to your surroundings.\n\n### Do not touch any metal parts of the camera during a thunderstorm.\nThis can cause an electric shock due to induced current from the lightning discharge.\n\n### Do not use the battery except as specified.\nLoad the battery as shown by the indicator.\n\n### Do not disassemble, modify, or heat batteries. Do not drop, strike, or throw batteries or otherwise subject them to strong impacts.\nDo not use batteries that show signs of leaking, deformation, discoloration, or other abnormalities. Use only designated chargers to recharge rechargeable batteries and do not attempt to recharge non-rechargeable Li-ion or alkaline batteries. Do not short batteries or store them with metallic objects. Failure to observe these precautions could result in the batteries overheating, igniting, rupturing, or leaking, causing fire, burns, or other injury.\n\n### Use only batteries or AC power adapters specified for use with this camera.\nDo not use voltages other than the power supply voltage shown. The use of other power sources can cause a fire.\n\n### If the battery leaks and fluid gets in contact with your eyes, skin or clothing, flush the affected area with clean water and seek medical attention or call an emergency number right away.\n\n### Do not use the charger to charge batteries other than those specified here.\nThe supplied charger is for use only with batteries of the type supplied with the camera. Using the charger to charge conventional batteries or other types of rechargeable batteries can cause the battery to leak, overheat or burst.\n\n### Using a flash too close to a person's eyes may cause visual impairment.\nTake particular care when photographing infants and young children.\n\n### Do not remain in prolonged contact with hot surfaces.\nDo not leave one part of the body in contact with the product for prolonged periods while the product is on. Failure to observe this precaution could result in low-temperature burns, particularly during prolonged use, at high ambient temperatures, when HIGH is selected for AUTO POWER OFF TEMP, or with users who suffer from poor circulation or reduced sensation, in which case use of a tripod or similar precautions are recommended.\n\n### Do not use in the presence of flammable objects, explosive gases, or dust.\n\n### When carrying the battery, install it in a digital camera or keep it in the hard case.\nWhen storing the battery, keep it in the hard case. When discarding, cover the battery terminals with insulation tape. Contact with other metallic objects or batteries could cause the battery to ignite or burst.\n\n### Keep memory cards, hot shoes, and other small parts out of the reach of small children.\nChildren may swallow small parts; keep out of reach of children. Should a child swallow a small part, seek medical attention or call emergency.\n\n### Keep out of reach of small children.\nAmong the elements that could cause injury are the strap, which could become entangled about a child's neck, causing strangulation, and the flash, which could cause visual impairment.\n\n### Follow the directions of airline and hospital personnel.\nThis product generates radio-frequency emissions that could interfere with navigational or medical equipment.\n",
