    "parsing_result": "## Subject Detection\n\n- A single subject of the chosen type detected in or near the focus area will be marked with a white frame.\n- If multiple subjects are detected in the focus area, the camera will select one automatically.\n- You can choose a different subject by tapping the display to reposition the focus area. The focus stick (focus lever) can also be used if **WIDE** is selected for **AF MODE**.\n- If the selected subject leaves the frame, the camera will wait a set time for its return, and consequently, the white frame may sometimes appear in locations where no subject of the chosen type is seen.\n- Depending on shooting conditions, subject detection may be suspended at the close of burst shooting.\n- Subjects can be detected with the camera in vertical or horizontal orientation.\n- Subject detection options can also be accessed via shortcuts (page 376).",
