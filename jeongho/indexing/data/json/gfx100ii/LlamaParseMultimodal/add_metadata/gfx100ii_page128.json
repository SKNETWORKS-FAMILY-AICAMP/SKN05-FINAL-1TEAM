The images can be viewed in Capture One Express for Fujifilm¹, Capture One for Fujifilm¹, Capture One¹, RAW FILE CONVERTER EX powered by SILKYPIX², FUJIFILM X RAW STUDIO, or other software that supports \"lossless\" RAW compression. Quality is the same as UNCOMPRESSED, but the resulting files are anywhere from about 30 to 90 percent (14-bit RAW) or 45 to 100 percent (16-bit RAW) of their uncompressed size. |\n| COMPRESSED    | RAW images are compressed using a \"lossy\", non-reversible algorithm. Quality is about the same as UNCOMPRESSED, but the resulting files are anywhere from about 25 to 35 percent (14-bit RAW) or 30 to 40 percent (16-bit RAW) of their uncompressed size.                                                                                   |\n\n¹ For information on when support will be available, visit: https://www.captureone.com/\n\n² For information on when support will be available, visit: https://fujifilm-x.com/support/compatibility/software/raw-file-converter-ex-powered-by-silkypix/\n\n## OUTPUT DEPTH (bit)\n\n| Option | Description                                      |\n|--------|--------------------------------------------------|\n| 16bit  | RAW pictures are recorded at a bit depth of 16 bits. |\n| 14bit  | RAW pictures are recorded at a bit depth of 14 bits. |\n\n> ⚠️ **16bit is available in STILL IMAGE and PIXEL SHIFT MULTI SHOT drive modes only.**",
