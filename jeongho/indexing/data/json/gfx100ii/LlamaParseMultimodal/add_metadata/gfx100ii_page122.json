For this purpose, use FUJIFILM Pixel Shift Combiner.\n- The flash will synchronize with the shutter at shutter speeds of ⅓ s or slower (14-bit RAW) or ½ s or slower (16-bit RAW).\n- The following limitations apply to the use of the pixel-shift multi-shot option:\n  - Pixel-shift multi-shot photography can only be performed using the electronic shutter.\n  - Sensitivity is restricted to a maximum of ISO 1600. Choosing higher values or a setting of **AUTO** results in a sensitivity of ISO 1600, while lower values remain unchanged.\n  - The only option available for **RAW RECORDING** is **LOSSLESS COMPRESSED**.\n  - Pictures taken with **C** (AF-C) selected for focus mode will be shot in focus mode **S** (AF-S). Pictures taken with **S** (AF-S) or **M** (manual) selected are shot in the chosen focus mode.\n  - If the subject or camera moves during shooting, the desired results may not be achieved when the shots are combined.\n  - **SHOOTING SETTING > FLICKER REDUCTION** is automatically set to **OFF**.\n  - The value selected for exposure compensation applies to all 4 or 16 shots.",
