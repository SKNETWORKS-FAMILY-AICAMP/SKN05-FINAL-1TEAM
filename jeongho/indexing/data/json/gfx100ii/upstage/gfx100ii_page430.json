Incorrect use can shorten battery life or\ncause leakage, overheating, fire, or explosion.\n\nLi-ion Batteries\n\nRead this section if your camera uses a rechargeable Li-ion\nbattery.\n\nThe battery is not charged at shipment. Charge the battery\nbefore use. Keep the battery in its case when not in use.\n\nNotes on the Battery\n\nThe battery gradually loses its charge when not in use.\nCharge the battery one or two days before use.\n\nBattery life can be extended by turning the camera off when\nnot in use.\n\nBattery capacity decreases at low temperatures; a depleted\nbattery may not function when cold. Keep a fully charged\nspare battery in a warm place and exchange as necessary,\nor keep the battery in your pocket or other warm place and\ninsert it in the camera only when shooting. Do not place the\nbattery in direct contact with hand warmers or other heating\ndevices.\n\nCharging the Battery\n\nThe battery can be charged using the camera and supplied\nAC adapter or an optional BC-W235 dual battery charger.\nCharging times will increase at ambient temperatures below\n+10°C (+50°F) or above +35 °C (+95 °F).

Charge the battery regularly.\n\nStorage\n\nIf the camera will not be used for an extended period, store\nit at room temperature with the battery charged to approxi-\nmately one half to 2/3 capacity.\n\nIf the camera will not be used for an extended period, re-\nmove the battery and store it in a dry place with an ambient\ntemperature of from +15 °C to +25 °C (+59°F to +77 °F).
