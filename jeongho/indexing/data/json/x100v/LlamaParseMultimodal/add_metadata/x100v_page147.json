Choose the electronic shutter to mute the shutter sound.\n\n| Option                      | Description                                                   |\n|-----------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|\n| **MS MECHANICAL SHUTTER**   | Take pictures with the mechanical shutter.                    |\n| **ES ELECTRONIC SHUTTER**   | Take pictures with the electronic shutter.                    |\n| **M+E MECHANICAL + ELECTRONIC** | The camera chooses the mechanical or electronic shutter according to shooting conditions. |\n\nIf **ES ELECTRONIC SHUTTER** or **M+E MECHANICAL + ELECTRONIC** is selected, shutter speeds faster than 1/4000 s can be chosen by rotating the shutter speed dial to 4000 and then rotating the rear command dial.\n\n> 💡 **Note:**\n> - When using the electronic shutter, note the following:\n>   - Distortion may be visible in shots of moving subjects.\n>   - Distortion may also be visible in hand-held shots taken at high shutter speeds; use of a tripod is recommended.\n>   - Banding and fog may occur in shots taken under fluorescent lights or other flickering or erratic illumination.\n>   - When taking pictures with the shutter muted, respect your subjects' image rights and right to privacy.\n> - When **MS MECHANICAL SHUTTER** is selected, exposure may be less accurate at wider apertures (the maximum shutter speed varies with the aperture, from 1/2000 s at f/2 to 1/4000 s at f/4.5). The timing of the switch from **MECHANICAL SHUTTER** to **ELECTRONIC SHUTTER** when **M+E MECHANICAL + ELECTRONIC** is selected also varies with aperture.\n\n> ⚠️ **Restrictions:**\n> - The following restrictions apply when the electronic shutter is used:\n>   - \"Extended\" sensitivity values are not supported.\n>   - Long exposure noise reduction has no effect.\n>   - The flash cannot be used.",
