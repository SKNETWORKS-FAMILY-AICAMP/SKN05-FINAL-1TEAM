The subject is in sharp focus so that their expression is always visible. <br> - The OVF shows the area just outside the frame, making it easier to compose shots. <br> - Because the viewfinder window is a slight distance from the lens, the area visible in photographs may however differ slightly from the display in the viewfinder due to parallax. |\n| **EVF** | - The EVF offers 100% frame coverage for increased accuracy when composing shots. <br> - It can be used to preview depth of field, focus, exposure, and white balance. |\n| **ERF** | As for the optical viewfinder but with a focus preview window. |",
