You may need to lower exposure compensation depending on the number of shots.                        |\n| AVERAGE  | The camera automatically optimizes exposure for the final picture. The background in series shot without changing the composition will be optimally exposed. |\n| BRIGHT   | The camera compares the exposures and chooses only the brightest pixel at each location. Colors may be mixed depending on their brightness and hue. |\n| DARK     | The camera compares the exposures and chooses only the darkest pixel at each location. Colors may be mixed depending on their brightness and hue. |\n\n> ðŸ’¡ **Note:**  \n> The camera can combine up to nine exposures.",
