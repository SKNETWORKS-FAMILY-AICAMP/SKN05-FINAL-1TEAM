Available only if the unit is mounted on the camera hot shoe as a master flash for Fujifilm optical wireless remote flash control in **TTL**, **TTL%**, or **M** mode. |\n| **Number of flashes** | Choose the number of times the flash fires each time the shutter is released in **MULTI** mode.                                                                                                          |\n| **Channel**       | Choose the channel used by the master flash for communication with the remote flash units. Separate channels can be used for different flash systems or to prevent interference when multiple systems are operating in close proximity. |\n| **Frequency**     | Choose the frequency at which the flash fires in **MULTI** mode.                                                                                                                                              |\n",
