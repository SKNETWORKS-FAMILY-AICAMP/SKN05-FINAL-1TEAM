To have the camera focus on a different subject, tap inside the gray border. The icon will change from white to green.\n- You can also switch subjects by pressing the function button to which **FACE SELECT** is assigned and then using the focus stick (focus lever) or (during viewfinder photography) touch controls.\n- To switch from face detection to manual focus-area selection, press the center of the focus stick (focus lever). Press again to re-enable face detection.\n- If the selected subject leaves the frame, the camera will wait a set time for its return and consequently the green frame may sometimes appear in locations where no face is seen.\n- You cannot switch subjects during burst photography.\n- Depending on shooting conditions, face selection may be suspended at the close of burst shooting.\n- Faces can be detected with the camera in vertical or horizontal orientation.\n- If the camera is unable to detect the subjectâ€™s eyes because they are hidden by hair, glasses, or other objects, the camera will instead focus on faces.\n- Face/eye detection options can also be accessed via shortcuts (page 244).",
