When installing an outside antenna system, extreme care should be taken to keep from touching such power lines or circuits as contact with them might be fatal.\n\n### Use\n\n#### Cleaning\nUnplug this video product from the wall outlet before cleaning. Do not use liquid cleaners or aerosol cleaners. Use a damp cloth for cleaning.\n\n#### Object and Liquid Entry\nNever push objects of any kind into this video product through openings as they may touch dangerous voltage points or short out parts that could result in a fire or electric shock. Never spill liquid of any kind on the video product.\n\n#### Lightning\nFor added protection for this video product receiver during a lightning storm, or when it is left unattended and unused for long periods of time, unplug it from the wall outlet and disconnect the antenna or cable system. This will prevent damage to the video product due to lightning and power-line surges.\n\n### Service\n\n#### Servicing\nDo not attempt to service this video product yourself as opening or removing covers may expose you to dangerous voltage or other hazards. Refer all servicing to qualified service personnel.\n\n#### Damage Requiring Service\nUnplug this video product from the wall outlet and refer servicing to qualified service personnel under the following conditions:\n- When the power-supply cord or plug is damaged\n- If liquid has been spilled, or objects have fallen into the video product\n- If the video product has been exposed to rain or water\n- If the video product has been dropped or the cabinet has been damaged\n\nIf the video product does not operate normally follow the operating instructions. Adjust only those controls that are covered by the operating instructions as an improper adjustment of other controls may result in damage and will often require extensive work by a qualified technician to restore the video product to its normal operation.\n\nWhen the video product exhibits a distinct change in performance—this indicates a need for service.\n\n#### Replacement Parts\nWhen replacement parts are required, be sure the service technician has used replacement parts specified by the manufacturer or have the same characteristics as the original part. Unauthorized substitutions may result in fire, electric shock or other hazards.\n\n#### Safety Check\nUpon completion of any service or repairs to this video product, ask the service technician to perform safety checks to determine that the video product is in proper operating condition.\n\n----\n\n### Safety Notes\n\n- Make sure that you use your camera correctly. Read these safety notes and your Owner’s Manual carefully before use.\n- After reading these safety notes, store them in a safe place.\n\n### About the Icons\n\nThe icons shown below are used in this document to indicate the severity of the injury or damage that can result if the information indicated by the icon is ignored and the product is used incorrectly as a result.\n\n- **WARNING**: This icon indicates that death or serious injury can result if the information is ignored.\n- **CAUTION**: This icon indicates that personal injury or material damage can result if the information is ignored.\n\nThe icons shown below are used to indicate the nature of the instructions which are to be observed.\n\n- Triangular icons tell you that this information requires attention (“Important”).\n- Circular icons with a diagonal bar tell you that the action indicated is prohibited (“Prohibited”).\n- Filled circles with an exclamation mark indicate an action that must be performed (“Required”).\n\n### Symbols\n\nThe symbols on the product (including the accessories) represent the following:\n- **AC**\n- **DC**\n- **Class II equipment** (The construction of the product is double-insulated.)\n\n!Warning Icon\n\n> **WARNING**\n> \n> If a problem arises, turn the camera off, remove the battery, disconnect the USB cable, and unplug the AC power adapter. Continued use of the camera when it is emitting smoke, is emitting any unusual odor, or is in any other abnormal state can cause a fire or electric shock. Contact your Fujifilm dealer.\n> \n> Do not allow water or foreign objects to enter the camera or connecting cables. Do not use the camera or connecting cables following ingress of fresh or salt water, milk, beverages, detergents, or other liquids. Should liquid find its way into the camera or connecting cables, turn the camera off, remove the battery, disconnect the USB cable, and disconnect and unplug the AC adapter. Continued use of the camera can cause a fire or electric shock. Contact your Fujifilm dealer.\n",
