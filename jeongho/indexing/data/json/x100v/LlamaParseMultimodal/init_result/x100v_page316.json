This can damage the power cord or cables and cause a fire or electric shock.\n- **Do not cover or wrap the camera or the AC power adapter in a cloth or blanket.** This can cause heat to build up and distort the casing or cause a fire.\n- **Do not use the plug if it is damaged or if it does not fit securely into the outlet.** Failure to observe this precaution could result in fire or electric shock.\n- **When you are cleaning the camera or you do not plan to use the camera for an extended period, remove the battery and disconnect and unplug the AC power adapter.** Failure to do so can cause a fire or electric shock.\n\n# Caution\n\n- **When charging ends, unplug the charger from the power socket.** Leaving the charger plugged into the power socket can cause a fire.\n- **When a memory card is removed, the card could come out of the slot too quickly. Use your finger to hold it and gently release the card.** Injury could result to those struck by the ejected card.\n- **Request regular internal testing and cleaning for your camera.** Build-up of dust in your camera can cause a fire or electric shock. Contact your Fujifilm dealer to request internal cleaning every two years. Please note that this service is not free of charge.\n- **Danger of explosion if battery is incorrectly replaced.** Replace only with the same or equivalent type.\n- **Batteries (battery pack or batteries installed) shall not be exposed to excessive heat such as sunshine, fire or the like.**\n\n# The Battery and Power Supply\n\n> **Note:** Check the type of battery used in your camera and read the appropriate sections.\n\n> ⚠️ **WARNING:** Battery shall not be exposed to excessive heat such as sunshine, fire or the like.\n\nThe following describes the proper use of batteries and how to prolong their life. Incorrect use can shorten battery life or cause leakage, overheating, fire, or explosion.\n\n## Li-ion Batteries\n\nRead this section if your camera uses a rechargeable Li-ion battery.\n\n- The battery is not charged at shipment. Charge the battery before use. Keep the battery in its case when not in use.\n\n### Notes on the Battery\n\n- The battery gradually loses its charge when not in use. Charge the battery one or two days before use.\n- Battery life can be extended by turning the camera off when not in use.\n- Battery capacity decreases at low temperatures; a depleted battery may not function when cold. Keep a fully charged spare battery in a warm place and exchange as necessary, or keep the battery in your pocket or other warm place and insert it in the camera only when shooting. Do not place the battery in direct contact with hand warmers or other heating devices.\n\n### Charging the Battery\n\n- The battery can also be charged using an optional BC-W126S battery charger. Charging times will increase at ambient temperatures below +10°C (+50°F) or above +35°C (+95°F). Do not attempt to charge the battery at temperatures above +40°C (+104°F); at temperatures below +5°C (+41°F), the battery will not charge.\n- Do not attempt to recharge a fully charged battery. The battery does not however need to be fully discharged before charging.\n\n### Battery Life\n\n- At normal temperatures, the battery can be recharged about 300 times. A noticeable decrease in the length of time the battery will hold a charge indicates that it has reached the end of its service life and should be replaced.\n\n### Storage\n\n- Performance may be impaired if the battery is left unused for extended periods when fully charged. Run the battery flat before storing it.\n- If the camera will not be used for an extended period, remove the battery and store it in a dry place with an ambient temperature of from +15°C to +25°C (+59°F to +77°F). Do not store in locations exposed to extremes of temperature.\n\n### Cautions: Handling the Battery\n\n- Do not transport or store with metal objects such as necklaces or hairpins.\n- Do not expose to flame or heat.\n- Do not disassemble or modify.\n- Use with designated chargers only.\n- Dispose of used batteries promptly.\n- Do not drop or subject to strong physical shocks.\n- Do not expose to water.\n- Keep the terminals clean.\n- The battery and camera body may become warm to the touch after extended use. This is normal.\n\n### Caution: Disposal\n\n- Dispose of used batteries in accord with local regulations. Attention should be drawn to the environmental aspects of battery disposal. Use the apparatus under moderate climate.\n",
