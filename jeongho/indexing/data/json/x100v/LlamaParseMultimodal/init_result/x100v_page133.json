Light sources with a color temperature close to that of direct sunlight appear white; light sources with a lower color temperature have a yellow or red cast, while those with a higher color temperature are tinged with blue.\n\n## DYNAMIC RANGE\n\nControl contrast. Choose lower values to increase contrast when shooting indoors or under overcast skies, higher values to reduce loss of detail in highlights when photographing high-contrast scenes. Higher values are recommended for scenes that include both sunlight and deep shade, for such high-contrast subjects as sunlight on water, brightly-lit autumn leaves, and portraits taken against a blue sky, and for white objects or people wearing white.\n\n### Options\n\n- **AUTO**\n- **100%**\n- **200%**\n- **400%**\n\n> ⚠️ Mottling may appear in pictures taken at higher values. Choose a value according to the scene.\n\n- If **AUTO** is selected, the camera will automatically choose either **100%** or **200%** according to the subject and shooting conditions. Shutter speed and aperture will be displayed when the shutter button is pressed halfway.\n- **200%** is available at sensitivities from ISO 320 to ISO 12800.\n- **400%** at sensitivities from ISO 640 to 12800.",
