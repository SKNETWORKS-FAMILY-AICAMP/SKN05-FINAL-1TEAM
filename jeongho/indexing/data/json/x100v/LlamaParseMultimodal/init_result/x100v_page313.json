            "md": "# For Your Safety\n\n## IMPORTANT SAFETY INSTRUCTIONS\n\n- **Read Instructions:** All the safety and operating instructions should be read before the appliance is operated.\n- **Retain Instructions:** The safety and operating instructions should be retained for future reference.\n- **Heed Warnings:** All warnings on the appliance and in the operating instructions should be adhered to.\n- **Follow Instructions:** All operating and use instructions should be followed.\n\n### Installation\n\n- **Power Sources:** This video product should be operated only from the type of power source indicated on the marking label. If you are not sure of the type of power supply to your home, consult your appliance dealer or local power company. For video products intended to operate from battery power, or other sources, refer to the operating instructions.\n\n- **Grounding or Polarization:** This video product is equipped with a polarized alternating-current line plug (a plug having one blade wider than the other). This plug will fit into the power outlet only one way. This is a safety feature. If you are unable to insert the plug fully into the outlet, try reversing the plug. If the plug should still fail to fit, contact your electrician to replace your obsolete outlet. Do not defeat the safety purpose of the polarized plug.\n\n- **Alternate Warnings:** This video product is equipped with a three-wire grounding-type plug, a plug having a third (grounding) pin. This plug will only fit into a grounding-type power outlet. This is a safety feature. If you are unable to insert the plug into the outlet, contact your electrician to replace your obsolete outlet. Do not defeat the safety purpose of the grounding type plug.\n\n- **Overloading:** Do not overload wall outlets and extension cords as this can result in a risk of fire or electric shock.\n\n- **Ventilation:** Slots and openings in the cabinet are provided for ventilation, to ensure reliable operation of the video product and to protect it from overheating, and these openings must not be blocked or covered. The openings should never be blocked by placing the video product on a bed, sofa, rug, or other similar surface.\n\n  This video product should not be placed in a built-in installation such as a bookcase or rack unless proper ventilation is provided or the manufacturer’s instructions have been adhered to. This video product should never be placed near or over a radiator or heat register.\n\n- **Attachments:** Do not use attachments not recommended by the video product manufacturer as they may cause hazards.\n\n- **Water and Moisture:** Do not use this video product near water—for example, near a bath tub, wash bowl, kitchen sink, or laundry tub, in a wet basement, or near a swimming pool, and the like.\n\n### Power-Cord Protection\n\nPower-supply cords should be routed so that they are not likely to be walked on or pinched by items placed upon or against them, paying particular attention to cords at plugs, convenience receptacles, and the point where they exit from the appliance.\n\n### Accessories\n\nDo not place this video product on an unstable cart, stand, tripod, bracket, or table. The video product may fall, causing serious injury to a child or adult, and serious damage to the appliance. Use only with a cart, stand, tripod, bracket, or table recommended by the manufacturer, or sold with the video product. Any mounting of the appliance should follow the manufacturer’s instructions, and should use a mounting accessory recommended by the manufacturer.\n\nAn appliance and cart combination should be moved with care. Quick stops, excessive force, and uneven surfaces may cause the appliance and cart combination to overturn.\n\n### Antennas\n\n#### Outdoor Antenna Grounding\n\nIf an outside antenna or cable system is connected to the video product, be sure the antenna or cable system is grounded so as to provide some protection against voltage surges and built-up static charges. Section 810 of the National Electrical Code, ANSI/NFPA No. 70, provides information with respect to proper grounding of the mast and supporting structure, grounding of the lead-in wire to an antenna discharge unit, size of grounding conductors, location of antenna discharge unit, connection to grounding electrodes, and requirements for the grounding electrode.\n\n!Example of Antenna Grounding as per National Electrical Code",
