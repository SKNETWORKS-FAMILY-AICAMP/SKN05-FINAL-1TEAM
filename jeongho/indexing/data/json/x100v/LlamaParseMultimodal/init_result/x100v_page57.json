This could make it impossible to remove the battery from the camera.\n- Do not short the battery terminals. The battery could overheat.\n- Read the cautions in \"The Battery and Power Supply.\"\n- Use only genuine Fujifilm rechargeable batteries designated for use in this camera. Failure to observe this precaution could result in product malfunction.\n- Do not remove the labels from the battery or attempt to split or peel the outer casing.\n- The battery gradually loses its charge when not in use. Charge the battery one or two days before use.\n- If the battery fails to hold a charge, it has reached the end of its charging life and must be replaced.\n- Remove dirt from the battery terminals with a clean, dry cloth. Failure to observe this precaution could prevent the battery from charging.\n- Note that charging times increase at low or high temperatures.\n\n### Additional Information\n\n- If the camera is turned on during charging, charging will end and the USB connection will instead be used to power the camera. The battery level will begin to gradually decline.\n- The camera will display an \"external power source\" icon when powered via USB.",
