    "parsing_result": "# Using a Conversion Lens\n\nThe camera automatically adjusts settings when it detects that an optional dedicated WCL-X100 II or TCL-X100 II teleconversion lens is attached. An icon (!Conversion Lens Icon) will appear in the display.\n\n- The camera does not detect WCL-X100 or TCL-X100 conversion lenses automatically. Select **WIDE** or **TELE** for **SHOOTING SETTING > CONVERSION LENS** in the shooting menu.\n- Because the optical viewfinder does not cover the full field of view of wide conversion lenses, the bright frame is replaced by out-of-frame indicators when a wide conversion lens is attached. For accurate framing, compose pictures using the electronic viewfinder or LCD monitor.\n- The built-in flash may fail to light the entire subject. We recommend using an optional external flash designated for use with this camera.\n- Select **OFF** for **SHOOTING SETTING > CONVERSION LENS** when a conversion lens is not in use.",
