Red-eye removal minimizes \"red-eye\" caused when light from the flash is reflected from the subjectâ€™s retinas.\n\n## Flash Sync Speed\nThe flash will synchronize with the shutter at shutter speeds of 1/2000 s or slower.\n\n## Optional Flash Units from Fujifilm\nThe camera can be used with optional Fujifilm shoe-mounted flash units.\n\n## Third-Party Flash Units\nDo not use third-party flash units that apply over 300 V to the camera hot shoe.",
