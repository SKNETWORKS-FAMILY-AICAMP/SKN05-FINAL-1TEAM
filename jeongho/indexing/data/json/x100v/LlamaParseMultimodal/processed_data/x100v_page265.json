Some units allow the adjustment to be made from the camera. Select **AUTO** to automatically match coverage to focal length when using optional conversion lenses. |\n| ⑥ Lighting         | If the unit supports this feature, choose from:  • **(FLASH POWER PRIORITY)**: Gain range by slightly reducing coverage.  • **(STANDARD)**: Match coverage to picture angle.  • **(EVEN COVERAGE PRIORITY)**: Slightly increase coverage for more even lighting. |\n| ⑦ LED light        | Choose how the built-in LED light functions during still photography (compatible units only): as a catchlight (**/CATCHLIGHT**), as an AF-assist illuminator (**AF/AF ASSIST**), or as both a catchlight and an AF-assist illuminator (**/AF ASSIST+CATCHLIGHT**). Choose **OFF** to disable the LED during photography. |\n| ⑦ Number of flashes* | Choose the number of times the flash fires each time the shutter is released in **MULTI** mode.                                                                                                             |\n| ⑧ Frequency*       | Choose the frequency at which the flash fires in **MULTI** mode.                                                                                                                                             |\n\n* Full value may not be applied if limits of flash control system are exceeded.\n",
