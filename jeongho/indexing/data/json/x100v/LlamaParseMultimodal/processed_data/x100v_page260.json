Some can function as master flash units controlling remote units via optical wireless flash control.\n\n> ðŸ’¡ **Note:**  \n> You may be unable to test-fire the flash in some circumstances, for example when a setup menu is displayed on the camera.\n\n## Red-Eye Removal\n\nRed-eye removal is available when an option other than **OFF** is selected for **FLASH SETTING > RED EYE REMOVAL** and a **FACE DETECTION ON** option is selected for **AF/MF SETTING > FACE/EYE DETECTION SETTING**. Red-eye removal minimizes \"red-eye\" caused when light from the flash is reflected from the subjectâ€™s retinas.",
