The options available vary with the shooting mode (**P, S, A,** or **M**) selected.                                                                                 |\n|                  | - **⚡TTL (FLASH AUTO):** The flash fires only as required; flash level is adjusted according to subject brightness. A flash icon displayed when the shutter button is pressed halfway indicates that the flash will fire when the photo is taken. |\n|                  | - **⚡TTL (STANDARD):** The flash fires with every shot if possible; flash level is adjusted according to subject brightness. The flash will not fire if not fully charged when the shutter is released.                                              |\n|                  | - **⚡TTL (SLOW SYNC.):** Combine the flash with slow shutter speeds when photographing portrait subjects against a backdrop of night scenery. The flash will not fire if not fully charged when the shutter is released.                             |\n| ⑧ Sync          | Control flash timing.                                                                                                                                                                                         |\n|                  | - **⚡FRONT (1ST CURTAIN):** The flash fires immediately after the shutter opens (generally the best choice).                                                                                                  |\n|                  | - **⚡REAR (2ND CURTAIN):** The flash fires immediately before the shutter closes.                                                                                                                             |\n| ⑨ Zoom          | The angle of illumination (flash coverage) for units that support flash zoom. Some units allow the adjustment to be made from the camera. Select **AUTO** to automatically match coverage to focal length when using optional conversion lenses.     |\n",
