    "parsing_result": "# External Flash Units\n\n## Settings and Descriptions\n\n### 7. Flash Mode (TTL)\nChoose a flash mode for TTL flash control. The options available vary with the shooting mode (P, S, A, or M) selected.\n\n- **TTL (FLASH AUTO):** The flash fires only as required; flash level is adjusted according to subject brightness. A flash icon displayed when the shutter button is pressed halfway indicates that the flash will fire when the photo is taken.\n- **TTL (STANDARD):** The flash fires with every shot if possible; flash level is adjusted according to subject brightness. The flash will not fire if not fully charged when the shutter is released.\n- **TTL (SLOW SYNC.):** Combine the flash with slow shutter speeds when photographing portrait subjects against a backdrop of night scenery. The flash will not fire if not fully charged when the shutter is released.\n\n### 8. Sync\nControl flash timing.\n\n- **1ST CURTAIN:** The flash fires immediately after the shutter opens (generally the best choice).\n- **2ND CURTAIN:** The flash fires immediately before the shutter closes.\n- **AUTO FP (HSS):** High-speed sync (compatible units only). The camera automatically engages front-curtain high-speed sync at shutter speeds faster than the flash sync speed. Equivalent to 1ST CURTAIN when MULTI is selected for flash control mode.\n\n### 9. Zoom\nThe angle of illumination (flash coverage) for units that support flash zoom. Some units allow the adjustment to be made from the camera. If AUTO is selected, zoom will automatically be adjusted to match coverage to lens focal length.\n\n### 10. Lighting\nIf the unit supports this feature, choose from:\n\n- **FLASH POWER PRIORITY:** Gain range by slightly reducing coverage.\n- **STANDARD:** Match coverage to picture angle.\n- **EVEN COVERAGE PRIORITY:** Slightly increase coverage for more even lighting.",
