Flash Control Mode\n- **M**: A trigger signal is transmitted via the hot shoe X contacts when a picture is taken. Choose a shutter speed slower than the sync speed; even slower speeds may be required if the unit uses long flashes or has a slow response time.\n- **OFF**: The trigger signal is disabled.\n\n### 2. Sync\nChoose whether the flash is timed to fire immediately after the shutter opens (1ST CURTAIN) or immediately before it closes (2ND CURTAIN). 1ST CURTAIN is recommended in most circumstances.\n\n## The Sync Terminal\nUse the sync terminal to connect flash units that require a sync cable.\n\n!Sync Terminal Connection",
