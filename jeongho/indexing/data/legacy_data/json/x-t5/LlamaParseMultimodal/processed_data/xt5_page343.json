Flash Control Mode\nChoose from the following options:\n- **TTL**: TTL mode. Adjust flash compensation (②) and choose a flash mode (③).\n- **M**: The flash fires at the selected output (②) regardless of subject brightness or camera settings. Output is expressed in fractions of full power, from 1/1 to 1/64. The desired results may not be achieved at low values if they exceed the limits of the flash control system; take a test shot and check the results.\n- **COMMANDER**: Choose if the flash is being used to control remote synced flash units, for example as part of a studio flash system.\n- **OFF**: The EF-X8 does not fire. Flash units connected via the sync terminal will still fire when the shutter is released, but can be disabled by lowering the EF-X8 and turning the units off in the flash settings menu.\n\n### 2. Flash Compensation/Output\nAdjust flash level. The options available vary with the flash control mode (①).",
