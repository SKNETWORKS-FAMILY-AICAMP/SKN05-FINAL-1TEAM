Images taken with the camera are unaffected.\n\n## Problem: The camera does not focus.\n\n### Solution:\n- **The subject is not suited to autofocus:** Use focus lock or manual focus (ðŸ“– 101).\n- **The focus area is too small for the intended subject:** Increase the size of the focus area by a couple of steps (ðŸ“– 88).",
