    "parsing_result": "# External Flash Units\n\nUse optional external flash units for flash photography. Some units support high-speed sync (FP) and can be used at shutter speeds faster than the flash sync speed, while others can function as commanders controlling remote units via optical wireless flash control.\n\n> You may be unable to test-fire the flash in some circumstances, for example when a setup menu is displayed on the camera.\n\n## Red-Eye Removal\nRed-eye removal is available when **FLASH** is selected for **FLASH SETTING > RED EYE REMOVAL**. Red-eye removal minimizes \"red-eye\" caused when light from the flash is reflected from the subjectâ€™s retinas.\n\n## Flash Sync Speed\nThe flash will synchronize with the shutter at shutter speeds of 1/250 s or slower.\n\n## Optional Flash Units from Fujifilm\nThe camera can be used with optional Fujifilm shoe-mounted flash units.\n\n## Third-Party Flash Units\nDo not use third-party flash units that apply over 300 V to the camera hot shoe.",
