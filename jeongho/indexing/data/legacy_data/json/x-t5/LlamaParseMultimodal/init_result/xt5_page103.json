    "parsing_result": "## Using the Shutter Button\n\n1. **Press the shutter button all the way down.**\n   - The shutter will remain open for up to 60 minutes while the shutter button is pressed.\n   - The display shows the time elapsed since the exposure started.\n   - Releasing the shutter button closes the shutter, ending the exposure. Processing will begin, and the camera will display the processing time remaining.\n\n### Important Notes\n\n- Bulb photography is not available in drive modes other than STILL IMAGE or when the electronic shutter is selected for SHOOTING SETTING > SHUTTER TYPE.\n- Selecting an aperture of A fixes shutter speed at 30 s.\n- To reduce \"noise\" (mottling) in long time-exposures, select ON for IMAGE QUALITY SETTING > LONG EXPOSURE NR. Note that this may increase the time needed to record images after shooting.\n\n## Using a Remote Release\n\nA remote release can be used for long time-exposures. When using an optional RR-100 remote release or an electronic release from third-party suppliers, connect it to the cameraâ€™s remote release connector.\n\n!Remote Release Connection",
