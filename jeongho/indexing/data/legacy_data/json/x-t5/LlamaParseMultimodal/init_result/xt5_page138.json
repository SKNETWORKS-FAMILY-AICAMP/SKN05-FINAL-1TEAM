    "parsing_result": "# For Best Results\n\n- Move the camera slowly in a small circle at a steady speed.\n- Keep the camera parallel or at right angles to the horizon and be sure to pan only in the direction shown by the guides.\n- Try panning at a different speed if the desired results are not achieved.\n- Prop your elbows against your sides.\n- Use a tripod.\n- For best results, use a lens with a focal length of 35 mm or less (50 mm or less in 35 mm format).\n\n## Important Notes\n\n- If the shutter button is pressed all the way down before the panorama is complete, shooting will end and no panorama may be recorded.\n- The last part of the panorama may not be recorded if shooting ends before the panorama is complete.\n- Panoramas are created from multiple frames, and the camera may in some cases be unable to stitch the frames together perfectly.\n- Panoramas may be blurred if the subject is poorly lit.\n- Shooting may be interrupted if the camera is panned too quickly or too slowly. Panning the camera in a direction other than that shown cancels shooting.\n- The camera may in some cases record a greater or lesser angle than selected.\n- The desired results may not be achieved with:\n  - Moving subjects\n  - Subjects close to the camera\n  - Unvarying subjects such as the sky or a field of grass\n  - Subjects that are in constant motion, such as waves and waterfalls\n  - Subjects that undergo marked changes in brightness\n- If **ON** is selected for **BUTTON/DIAL SETTING > SHUTTER AE**, exposure for the entire panorama is determined by the first frame.",
