In the cases of the EF-X20, EF-20, and EF-42, the selected value is added to the value selected with the flash unit.\n- **M/MULTI:** Adjust flash output (compatible units only). Choose from values expressed as fractions of full power, from ½ (mode M) or ¼ (MULTI) down to 1/512 in increments equivalent to 1/3 EV. The desired results may not be achieved at low values if they exceed the limits of the flash control system; take a test shot and check the results.\n\n### Setting: Flash Mode (TTL)\n\n**Description:**\n\nChoose a flash mode for TTL flash control.
