    "parsing_result": "# Wireless Network and Bluetooth Devices: Cautions\n\nThis product complies with the following EU Directives:\n- RoHS Directive 2011/65/EU\n- RE Directive 2014/53/EU\n\nHereby, FUJIFILM Corporation declares that the radio equipment type FF220001 is in compliance with Directive 2014/53/EU.\n\nThe full text of the EU declaration of conformity is available at the following internet address:  \nhttps://dl.fujifilm-x.com/global/products/cameras/x-t5/pdf/x-t5_doc-ysk.pdf\n\nThe full text of the UK declaration of conformity is available at the following internet address:  \nhttps://dl.fujifilm-x.com/en-gb/products/cameras/x-t5/pdf/x-t5_doc-ysk_uk.pdf\n\nThis compliance is indicated by the following conformity marking placed on the product:\n\n!CE Marking\n\nThis marking is valid for non-Telecom products and EU harmonized Telecom products (e.g. Bluetooth®).\n\n- **Maximum radio-frequency power (EIRP):**  \n  WLAN 2.4 GHz: 12.17 dBm  \n  WLAN 5 GHz: 14.30 dBm  \n  Bluetooth: 3.69 dBm\n\n**IMPORTANT:** Read the following notices before using the camera’s built-in wireless transmitter.\n\n1. This product, which contains encryption function developed in the United States, is controlled by the United States Export Administration Regulations and may not be exported or re-exported to any country to which the United States embargoes goods.\n\n- **Use only a wireless network or Bluetooth device.** Fujifilm does not accept liability for damages resulting from unauthorized use. Do not use in applications requiring a high degree of reliability, for example in medical devices or other systems that may directly or indirectly impact human life. When using the device in computer and other systems that demand a greater degree of reliability than offered by wireless network or Bluetooth devices, be sure to take all necessary precautions to ensure safety and prevent malfunction.\n\n- **Use only in the country in which the device was purchased.** This device conforms to regulations governing wireless network and Bluetooth devices in the country in which it was purchased. Observe all location regulations when using the device. Fujifilm does not accept liability for problems arising from use in other jurisdictions.\n\n- **Do not use the device in locations subject to magnetic fields, static electricity, or radio interference.** Do not use the transmitter in the vicinity of microwave ovens or in other locations subject to magnetic fields, static electricity, or radio interference that may prevent reception of wireless signals. Mutual interference may occur when the transmitter is used in the vicinity of other wireless devices operating in the 2.4 GHz band.\n\n- **The wireless transmitter operates in the 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz bands using DSSS, OFDM, and GFSK modulation.**\n\n- **Security:** Wireless network and Bluetooth devices transmit data via radio and consequently their use requires greater attention to security than applies in the case of wired networks.\n  - Do not connect to unknown networks or networks to which you do not have access rights, even if they are displayed on your device, as such access may be considered unauthorized. Connect only to networks to which you have access rights.\n  - Be aware that wireless transmissions may be vulnerable to interception by third parties.\n  - Do not connect this device directly to telecommunications networks (including public wireless LANs) operated by providers or mobile, landline, Internet, or other telecommunications services.\n\n- **The following may be punishable by law:**\n  - Disassembly or modification of this device\n  - Removal of device certification labels\n\n- **This device operates on the same frequency as commercial, educational, and medical devices and wireless transmitters.** It also operates on the same frequency as licensed transmitters and special unlicensed low-voltage transmitters used in RFID tracking systems for assembly lines and in other similar applications.\n\n- **To prevent interference with the above devices, observe the following precautions.** Confirm that the RFID transmitter is not in operation before using this device. Should you observe that the device causes interference in licensed transmitters used for RFID tracking, immediately stop using the affected frequency or move the device to another location. If you notice that this device causes interference in low-voltage RFID tracing systems, contact a Fujifilm representative.",
