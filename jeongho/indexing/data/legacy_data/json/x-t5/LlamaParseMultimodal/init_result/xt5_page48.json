Brightness is shown by the horizontal axis, the number of pixels by the vertical axis.\n\n!Histogram Diagram\n\n- **Optimal exposure:** Pixels are distributed in an even curve throughout the tone range.\n- **Overexposed:** Pixels are clustered on the right side of the graph.\n- **Underexposed:** Pixels are clustered on the left side of the graph.\n\nTo view separate RGB histograms and a display showing areas of the frame that will be overexposed at current settings superimposed on the view through the lens, press the function button to which **HISTOGRAM** is assigned.\n\n1. Overexposed areas blink\n2. RGB histograms\n\n!RGB Histogram Display",
