Flash compensation can be adjusted separately for each group.                                                                                            |\n|                                        | - **TTL%**: If **TTL%** is selected for either group A or B, you can specify the output of the selected group as a percentage of the other and adjust overall flash compensation for both groups.            |\n| ② Flash control mode (group B)         | - **M**: In mode **M**, the units in the group fire at the selected output (expressed as a fraction of full power) regardless of subject brightness or camera settings.                                       |\n| ③ Flash control mode (group C)         | - **MULTI**: Choosing **MULTI** for any group sets all the units in all groups to repeating flash mode.

Note that the full value may not be applied if the limits of the flash control system are exceeded.            |\n| ⑤ Flash compensation/output (group B)  | - **TTL**: Adjust flash compensation.                                                                                                                                                                       |\n| ⑥ Flash compensation/output (group C)  | - **M/MULTI**: Adjust flash output.                                                                                                                                                                         |\n|                                        | - **TTL%**: Choose the balance between groups A and B and adjust overall flash compensation.                                                                                                                |\n",
