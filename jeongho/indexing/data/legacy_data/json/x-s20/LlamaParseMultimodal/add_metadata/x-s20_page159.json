The focus stick (focus lever) can also be used if **WIDE** is selected for **AF MODE**.\n- When **DIRECT AF POINT SELECTION** or **EDIT FOCUS AREA** is chosen for **BUTTON/DIAL SETTING > FOCUS LEVER SETTING > TILT**, you can also switch subjects using the focus stick (focus lever) or (during viewfinder photography) touch controls (ðŸ“– 25).\n- If the selected subject leaves the frame, the camera will wait a set time for its return and consequently the white frame may sometimes appear in locations where no subject of the chosen type is seen.\n- Depending on shooting conditions, subject detection may be suspended at the close of burst shooting.\n- Subjects can be detected with the camera in vertical or horizontal orientation.\n- Subject detection options can also be accessed via shortcuts (ðŸ“– 308).",
