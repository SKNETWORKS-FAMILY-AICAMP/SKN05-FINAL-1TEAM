    "parsing_result": "# RAW Footage Output\n\n- RAW footage output to external devices is not saved to the memory cards inserted in the camera.\n- In-camera image enhancements are not applied to the RAW output.\n- ISO sensitivity is restricted to values between ISO 1000 and ISO 12800.\n- Footage output to external devices is generated from the original RAW data and its quality, which varies with device specifications, may not be equal to that achieved as the end result of post-production or the like.\n- Focus zoom is not available when RAW is selected for HDMI output.\n- RAW footage output via HDMI to incompatible devices will not display correctly but will instead display as a mosaic.\n- RAW output is disabled in some movie and high-speed recording modes.\n\n# Fix Movie Crop Magnification\n\nFix the movie crop ratio at 1.29:1. This makes it easier to match crops after changing movie settings.\n\n| Options |        |\n|---------|--------|\n| ON      | OFF    |",
