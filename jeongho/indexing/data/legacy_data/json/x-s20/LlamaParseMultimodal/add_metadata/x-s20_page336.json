Wipe any water from the lens before adjusting zoom.\n\nA XF18-120mmF4 LM PZ WR lens is used here for illustrative purposes.\n\n!Power Zoom Lens Diagram\n\n| Control                      | Description                                                                                     |\n|------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| â‘  Zoom ring                  | Rotate the zoom ring to zoom in or out manually.                                                |\n| â‘¡ Zoom/focus control ring    | Rotate the zoom/focus control ring to zoom in or out using powered zoom.
