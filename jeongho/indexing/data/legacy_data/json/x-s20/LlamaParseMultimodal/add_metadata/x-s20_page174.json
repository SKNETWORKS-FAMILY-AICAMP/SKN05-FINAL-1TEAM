To return to the shooting display, press the ▶️ button again or wait until the start of the next interval.\n- The display turns off between shots and lights a few seconds before the next shot is taken.\n- The display can be activated at any time by pressing the shutter button.\n- The indicator lamp blinks green whenever the displays are off during interval-timer photography.\n- To continue shooting until the number of shots taken equals the number of exposures remaining at the time interval-timer photography started, set the number of shots to ∞.\n\n> 💡 **Note:**\n> - Large changes in subject brightness may make exposure appear erratic. We recommend that you choose shorter values for **INTERVAL TIMER SHOOTING > INTERVAL** with subjects that brighten or dim dramatically during shooting.\n> - In manual mode (mode **M**), exposure smoothing is only available if an AUTO option is selected for **ISO**.",
